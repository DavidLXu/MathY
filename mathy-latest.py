There are alreay bunch of math libraries using C
But how can we implement it ourselves?
Written Purely in Python from Ground up
For recreational use in summer holidays

NOTICE: This library is only for entertainment and 
does not ensure the precision to be tolerated

Simply use basic operations(+-*/) and some language
properties to achieve most of the functions;
Math is magic!

Tips:
1.In Python2, divide(/) two numbers get an integer
2.To avoid ambiquity, please run the script in Python3
